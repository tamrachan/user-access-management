# user-access-management

Cartesian (https://www.cartesian.com) requested me to code an automated user access management system in Python. The process before this system was developed was completely manual and time consuming. Using the data exported from the company's Linux servers in CSV form, I created a Graphical User Interface, using Tkinter, which could filter, display and update the CSV file data as required - data from the CSV file could be appended, removed. The system even includes a login system which uses email verification.

As the data provided is confidential, I did not include the file. However, the Python file containing the GUI and the automated user access management system is provided. This project is specific to the data provided by Cartesian as it was a bespoke project.
